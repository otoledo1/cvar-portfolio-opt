# Regime-Conditioned CVaR Portfolio Optimization
 


## Repo layout
 
Everything runs flat, in one directory — no nested folders. Every script
looks for a `data/` and/or `results/` subfolder sitting next to itself,
auto-creating them if needed. This was a deliberate simplification partway
through the project (see checklist history) rather than the originally
scaffolded `/scripts` + `/backtest` + `/optimization` split.

## Headline results (as of the last full run)
 
| Strategy | Ann. return | Ann. vol | Sharpe | Max drawdown |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Equal weight | 0.109 | 0.136 | 0.801 | -0.356 |
| Cap-weighted | 0.095 | 0.152 | 0.627 | -0.348 |
| Min variance | 0.093 | 0.121 | 0.769 | -0.284 |
| Mean-variance | 0.094 | 0.152 | 0.619 | -0.420 |
| Risk parity | 0.104 | 0.126 | 0.825 | -0.327 |
| Momentum | 0.102 | 0.136 | 0.751 | -0.330 |
| **Historical CVaR (ρ=0)** | **0.106** | **0.127** | **0.834** | **-0.275** |
| Regime-Aware CVaR (ρ=1) | 0.100 | 0.125 | 0.799 | -0.294 |
 
Historical CVaR (ρ=0) is the best performer on both Sharpe and max
drawdown. Regime-conditioning (ρ>0) does not improve on this and degrades
monotonically as ρ increases, an effect concentrated in and driven by the
dollar-strength regime specifically (see `diagnose_dollar_strength.py`
output and the checklist for the full mechanism discussion).
 
## Known simplifications (worth naming explicitly in the paper)
 
- **Cap weights** use current shares outstanding applied across the whole
  backtest history — captures price-driven market cap changes, not
  share-count changes (buybacks/issuances) over time.
- **Momentum baseline** is a concrete but unspecified-by-the-outline
  choice: equal-weight the top 6 of 12 stocks by trailing 12-month return.
- **Mean-variance risk aversion (λ=2.0)** is an untuned draft default.
- **Credit-spread (BAA10Y/BAMLH0A0HYM2)** was collected as a candidate
  regime feature but the frozen threshold rule never actually conditions
  on it — only VIX, rate-of-change in DGS10, dollar momentum, and equity
  momentum drive classification. Discovered after backtesting had begun;
  documented rather than retroactively fixed, to avoid post-hoc rule
  tweaking.
- **Rate-shock regime** has only 14 months across the full 30-year sample
  — thin, noisy, treat any rate-shock-specific finding cautiously.
- **Transaction costs** are applied as a post-hoc drag on realized
  returns for every strategy (not embedded in the optimization objective
  the way Formula 10 in the outline specifies), so the CVaR model and the
  six baselines are directly comparable on the same accounting basis.
